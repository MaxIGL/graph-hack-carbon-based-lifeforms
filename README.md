# In our GitHub you can find:

1. CO2 emission tracking first database from satellite imagery
2. Significant environmental events hosted in Filecoin service for our on chain -Archive
3. Subgraph code
4. Flux
5. Carbon Based Lifeforms Dapp Front & Back end code 

## OUR SOLUTION

Our project is composed of a CO2 tracking tool to create a unified subgraph database monitoring CO2 emissions and mitigations,  and a DAO protocol on the NEAR Blockchain. The Carbon Based Lifeforms DAO harnesses the power of its created database to help companies achieve their environmental goals, their marketing goals, as well as create a viable environment economy.

To solve traditional marketing strategy inefficiency issue, we are convinced that Transparency and Action-based marketing strategy is the future of Brands’ environmental representativity. That is why we developed Carbon Based Lifeforms, a community-based web3 protocol that can show companies that they can get a better return on their environmental strategy by using our all-in-one marketing strategy that provides them with :

1. Offsetting their carbon emissions via green projects exposure
2. Grow their visibility and their environmental representativity among the consumers
3. Insetting their carbon emissions via optimizing their carbon footprint and benefitting from top-tier experts and live data-monitoring to reduce their emissions
4. Create a long-lasting relationship with their consumers in creating consumer experience and a viable environment economy

All of this with the same traditional budget they were used to spend into pure public environmental communication strategy.

The Subgraph consisting of a unified database for live tracking CO2 emissions, CO2 Offsetting, CO2 insetting, and mitigations by the different actors in the world allow for anyone to build any dApp on the Environment field.

## OUR IMPLEMENTATIONS

To develop Carbon Based Lifeforms we used as Technical implementations:

Flux Oracle
IPFS
Subgraph
NEAR Blockchain
Innovative functionalities: company ranking, bounty hunting, green betting, DAO voting, and actions.

## CONCLUSION

Through company ranking, Green betting as well as the bounty-hunting and self employment missions, the client company created a viable environment economy with the company’s image at its core. Indeed that economy enables community growth and brand representativity inside of that community. This is our magic formula and our major innovation in the marketing field to say that we succeeded to have a marketing & communication impact, and effective environmental positive impact at the same time.
